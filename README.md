# CS106L : Standard C++ programming

This is a C++ programming course teached in Stanford University. It covers many modern features of C++  (c++11, c++17, c++20 ...), and will almost certainly help you understand C++ more in depth.

## Course Map

The important lectures are in bold. I feel much more comfortable to write c++ style code after learning this course.

- Structures
- **Uniform Initialization**
- **Reference**
- Streams
- Containers
- **Iterators**
- Function Templates
- **Lambda Function**
- Template Class
- Const-Correctness
- Operator overloading
- **Special Member Function**
- **Move Semantics**
- **Resource Acquisition Is Initialization**

## Programming Assignments

There are two programming assignments to help you practice what you have learned in class.

[WikiRacer](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106l/wikiracer.html) : You will implement a famous game in C++. 

[HashMap](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106l/hashmap2.html#) : You will implement a template container in C++, and compare it with the official STL implementation std::unordered_map<K, V>.
